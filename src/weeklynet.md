# 💬 Freq51 Weekly Net

Welcome to the **Freq51 Weekly Net** — a friendly, open mesh check‑in designed to bring people together, test gear, and keep our community connected.

Whether you’re a longtime ham, a Meshtastic tinkerer, or brand new to the mesh, this is your weekly excuse to hop on and say hi.

---

## 🌐 What Is the Weekly Net?

The Weekly Net is a **live Meshtastic check‑in** that helps bridge the gap between **ham radio operators** and **Meshtastic users**. It gives us real insight into who’s active, how well the mesh is performing, and whether messages are actually getting through.

Think of it as a roll call — but way cooler.

---

## 📅 When It Happens

🗓 **Every Wednesday**  
⏰ **5:00 PM – 11:59 PM (local time)**  

The net opens at 5:00 PM and runs through the end of the day, giving everyone plenty of time to check in — whether you’re early, late, or somewhere in between.

---

## 📡 How to Check In

Send a message on the mesh using **this exact format**:

```
(LONG NAME) - (CITY, STATE) #FREQ51
```

### ✅ Example

```
bashNinja - Bluffdale, UT #FREQ51
```

This format helps us reliably track participation and stats — so please stick to it.

## 💬 Follow Along on Discord

We also mirror the Weekly Net activity to Discord so everyone can watch the check-ins roll in — even if you’re not on the mesh at that moment.

🔗 **Join our Discord:** http://utahmesh.net/  
📍 **Channel:** `#mt-weekly-net`

All valid NET check-ins are automatically reported in this channel, making it easy for the community to:

- 👀 See who’s active each week
- 📡 Watch the mesh light up in real time
- 🤝 Stay connected from Discord and RF at the same time

📊 **NET Summary Report**  
A full summary of the Weekly Net — including total check-ins and activity stats — is automatically posted **the next morning on Thursday at 8:00 AM**.

⏰ **Discord Reminders**  
We also offer optional reminder posts on Discord for those who opt in:
- 🌅 A reminder **the morning of the NET**
- 🚀 A reminder **right when the NET starts at 5:00 PM**

It’s an easy way to stay in the loop and never miss a check-in, whether you’re on RF, Discord, or both.

💡 For those who want to dive deeper, the **Weekly Net bot commands** are detailed on our [Discord Commands page](discord.md#weekly-net-commands).

If you’re on Discord during the NET window, hop in and say hi!

## 🎯 Why Participate?

Checking in helps the entire network. The Weekly Net allows us to:

- 📊 Get a **real count of active people** (not just nodes)
- 🧪 Run **regular live tests** of radios, clients, and routing
- 💥 **Stress test the mesh** with real traffic
- 🤝 Strengthen the bridge between **ham radio** and **Meshtastic** communities

Plus… it’s just fun to see who’s out there each week.

---

## 📣 Make It a Habit

Set a reminder. Check in every Wednesday. Try new gear. Test a new antenna. Say hello from a new location.

The mesh is better when it’s used — and **you’re part of what makes it work**.

See you on the airwaves.  
**#FREQ51** 🚀
